# Repository with list of project list were completed for Practicum's Data Analyst professional training programs in Israel (Yandex100)

About the progeam: Yandex100 is a 9-month intensive online program designed to train talents to be successful Data Analysts. 
As part of the program I Developed a solid foundation of descriptive and predictive statistics, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Collection and Storage, hypothesis testing and storytelling with data.
I've Completed a deep dive into real projects, working with databases, data set preprocessing and preparing conclusions formatted as an analytical report.
*Coursework Includes*: EDA, Data Collection and Storage (SQL), Automation, Making Data-Informed Business Decisions (Testing), Building Complex Projects, Tableau

|[Business decision](https://github.com/art-gr/practicum-portfolio/blob/main/Business_Decisions_test/Business_decision.ipynb "Business decision") |Case study - Business decision making Together with the marketing department, I've compiled a list of hypotheses that may help boost revenue. I will prioritize these hypotheses, launch an A/B test, and analyze the results.|*Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib.pyplot, SciPy*|
|[Online Store](https://github.com/art-gr/practicum-portfolio/blob/main/games_store/game_store.ipynb "Online Store")|Data analyze, Data preprocessing , create a user profile for each region and test hypothesis. The notebooks also includes 'OFF THE RECORD' with web scraping simulation - overview|*Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib.pyplot, SciPy, seaborn, request, bs4, re, threading and more|
| [Gym Fitness - Customer Analysis, Forcast and Predictions](https://github.com/art-gr/practicum-portfolio/blob/main/gym_fitness_forcast_predictions/forcast_predict_gym.ipynb "Gym Fitness - Customer Analysis, Forcast and Predictions")|Gym Fitness is developing a customer interaction strategy based on analytical data and come up with a customer retention strategy. Data set features include Boolean data (0 /1) and few continuous features | *Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib.pyplot, SciPy, plotly, sklearn, math, plotly*|
|[Telecom: Identifying Ineffective Operators](https://github.com/art-gr/practicum-portfolio/blob/main/telecom_project/Telecom_project_.ipynb "Telecom: Identifying Ineffective Operators")|The virtual telephony service CallMeMaybe is developing a new function that will give supervisors information on the least effective operators. An operator is considered ineffective if they have a large number of missed incoming calls (internal and external) and a long waiting time for incoming calls. Moreover, if an operator is supposed to make outgoing calls, a small number of them is also a sign of ineffectiveness. I will Carry out exploratory data analysis, Identify ineffective operators, Test statistical hypotheses|*Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib.pyplot, SciPy, seaborn, plotly, math, datetime, pylab and more*|
|[semi_project-SQL](https://github.com/art-gr/practicum-portfolio/blob/main/semi_projects/SQL/sql.ipynb "semi_project-SQL")|import libraries and connecting to data on Yandex servers to demonstrate a number of SQL queries, sun-queries, JOINS and more|*Pandas, sqlalchemy*|
|[semi_project-A/B test](https://github.com/art-gr/practicum-portfolio/blob/main/semi_projects/ab_test/abtest_.ipynb "semi_project-A/B test")|Deticated project to a/b test. testing changes related to the introduction of an improved recommendation system when Expected result are within 14 days of signing up, users will show better conversion into product page views (the product_page event), product card views (product_card) and purchases (purchase). At each of the stage of the funnel product_page → product_card → purchase, there will be at least a 10% increase. |*Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib.pyplot, SciPy, seaborn, plotly, math, datetime, pylab and more*|
